# Page layout]-]-]
The Dracula Metaverse circles arround red and black. So titles and important terms would naturally circle arround blood/red themes. Other colors are to be used only for schematic purposes in examples or specific explaination. In other words titles should stay in nuances of red.
Titles get a typing code to easily differentiate their hierarchy without messing the markup langage : 
- Title 1]-]-]
- Title 2]-]
- Title 3]-
- Title 4-
- Title 5
# Tools]-]-]
We will list here the main tools used by the team. It is important to centralise all the work to avoid loosing time translating from one to another. It will concern specification document mostly. Right now no Trello nor scrum softwares are used.
## Github]-]
First of all, all documentation are priorized to Github, as versionning is crucial in case of mutliple contributors. The markup langage is substantial yet easy to use.
## Google doc]-]
Everything we cannot make on Github will be on GDoc : exporting PDF, layout, sheets, slides and so on. Some external document could be integrated as links in the github to ease the comprehension. This means Github have the last word. However the main strength of this cloud-based software resides on the real-time collaboration on the same document, which Github dont. Consequently it is advised to centralise all results in the github when in place.
