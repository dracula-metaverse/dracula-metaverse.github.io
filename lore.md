# Introduction]-]-]
This document will explain the deep tricks of the scenaristic world of DRC through all of its aspects : physics, magic, spirit, goals and potential for the gameplay. It is based on the preparatory work of this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QEGlU_vXSdl3czVx_2TrIHn0_z0Rg4zaEb4Sx6x7YVU/edit?usp=sharing).
# Spirit]-]-]
The project must keep its Dracula name somewhat, as it dictates the lore origin. Nonetheless we can play around its significance to find some original twists. The goal is to not remake again a lookalike already exploited numerous times in popculture, as it would lose most of its spice. Players and spectators are transported into a brand new world using brand new technologies. Naturally it is an obligation to follow this logic to preserve the high quality standart of the overall design.

First of all, what is Dracula ?  It originated from [Vlad III “The impaler” Basarab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler) depicted in literature as cruel and cunning. During the XX° century the medias knew an explosion of supports : radio, cinema, books, comics, board games and video games. During which amid countless iconic characters Dracula have been used. We can cite the films Underworld, the Vampyr series, Castlevania, and so on. The XXI° century haven't created internet and globalization of data, yet the world wide web exploded its use among most of the world population. All of this creativity linked together through game fandoms and others artists ; DRC being of course one link of a ever creating chain of projects !
   
Continuing forward, the second key of the lore is the 3.0 web. Of course it is not a culture nor a scenaristic universe. However this means we have to somewhat integrate it as inspiration for some NFT and blockchain lore mechanics. Doing it like a core would surely interfere with the other inspiration, for example the Dracula explained before. So this part must be a subtext of the whole picture. Once this cleared we can move to its impact. On one hand we have non fungible tokens which could be represented as non-reproductible knowledge, on the other hand the blockchain keeps a track of all previous "owners". Only by these two rules we can exploit a lot of elements, maybe too many to deal with. Simpler it is, better it will become.

The third raw material, and by far the most used, is our own world history going on each second. We have 10 000 years of history, and even a tiny recorded bit is enough to spout gigantic and complex lore by itself. Our objective is not to make again a Game-of-Thrones like, nonetheless it doesn't mean making an anonymous background for the game. This means simply to first settle a solid frame for the content, then making the content we need.

The last but not the least piece of spirit comes from dark fantasy tropes. This genre bases itself on surnatural elements (magic, creatures, reality bending) for tragic, horrific or gruesome plots in any setting. The writing is heavy, plus coupled with the previous points. That is why we keep a minimum of tragic to deepen the lore without translating into forced grimdark. Sometimes it is needed to spice the storyline.

It is important to first settle the physical dimension of this universe. Because all of the story doesn't revolve around a puny region. As every stellar object can impact culture, events and gravity, we have to detail them. Below a sketch of the different objects of the system. We ignore for now their signification, as we call a spade a spade.

*N.B. All astronomical values are put as aproximatives.*

## Solar system]-]
![Astronomy of DRC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/884688687126937600/971005038724001852/Drc_system.png)
The system is inspired from our own : a series of smaller planets revolutioning around a yellow dwarf. In this document they are detailed from the closest to the furthest from the sun.
### Tear]-
A mix between our [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)) and [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus). Smaller than our Earth with a small acid atmosphere giving its silverish apparence. It is called like that due to its color in most of cultures.

*Planet ray*         5,000km (+-1km)

*Planet atmosphere*  30km (+-1km)

*Distance to sun*    80,000,000km (+-1,000,000km)

*Gravity*            0.95G

*Revolution*         222 days

*Revolution angle*   neglibible

*inclinaison*        9°

*Rotation*           19 hours
### Jewel]-
A small gas planet with a green component. Its size is similar to earth but has way less mass. It is called like that due to its neon green atmosphere.

*Planet ray*         3,000km (+-1km)

*Planet atmosphere*  30km (+-1km)

*Distance to sun*    120,000,000km (+-1,000,000km)

*Gravity*            0.3G

*Revolution*         300 days

*Revolution angle*   neglibible

*inclinaison*        13°

*Rotation*           25 hours
### Earth]-
The planet is a bit older than ours (~5B years) but the geology has similar properties and composition. The planet has similar cycles and dimensions to simplify, as it would otherwise need to be justified. It is located within the zone where life is possible. It has two moons and a white ring, their total mass cumulates the rough same as our own moon.
### Red moon]-
The closest and biggest is red-colored due to a tiny atmosphere and layer of water hosting bacteria producing a reddish color. Its orbit is a bit bent.

*Planet ray*         900km (+-1km)

*Planet atmosphere*  1km

*Distance to Earth*  250,000km (+-1,000km)

*Gravity*            0.1G

*Revolution*         27 days

*Revolution angle*   5°

*inclinaison*        5°

*Rotation*           25 hours
### Dark moon]-
The second further away and smaller is a dark moon with a similar composition of the red but with no atmosphere. Its orbit is however way more vertical.

*Planet ray*         900km (+-1km)

*Planet atmosphere*  1km

*Distance to Earth*  300,000km (+-5,000km)

*Gravity*            0.08G

*Revolution*         23 days

*Revolution angle*   54°

*Rotation*           666 days
### White ring]-
A small ring of rock has been created by an [old moon which shattered a billion year ago when approaching the earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lheapd7bgLA). The bent is a bit more pronounced than the red moon.

*Distance to Earth*  5,000 to 10,000km

*Revolution*         3 to 10 days (depending on the distance)

*Revolution angle*   10°
### Protector eye]-
Behind earth resides a large planet of rock and gas, similar to Jupiter. Its sheer size served as an asteroid shield. Its ring is almost vertical and always facing the center, looking like an “eye” if looked through an optical lens. Its color is golden and its “iris” white-blue.

*Planet ray*         18,000km (+-10km)

*Planet atmosphere*  33,350,000km (+-1,000km)

*Distance to sun*    728,000,000km (+-2,000,000km)

*Gravity*            2.2G

*Revolution*         3,900 days

*Revolution angle*   neglibible

*inclinaison*        79°

*Rotation*           192 days
### Asteroid belt]-
We have then a basic asteroid belt spanning for hundreds of millions of kilometers
### Wanderer]-
until one last purple gas planet with a bent orbit takes centuries to alternate between upper and lower angle in one revolution.

Every culture on earth has different names and interpretations for these objects. This is why in the document the names will refer to these codes.
